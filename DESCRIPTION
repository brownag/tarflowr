Description: Provides a simple, high-level interface for creating
    and executing 'targets'-based workflows, so users can focus on their specific 
    analysis, not on pipeline orchestration. The philosophy of tarflowr is 
    based on the concept of arbitrary "work units." This package is experimental.
